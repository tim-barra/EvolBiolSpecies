###CODE FOR FIGURES IN 'THE EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY OF SPECIES' Oxford University Press, 2019.

##Author: Timothy G. Barraclough (t.barraclough@imperial.ac.uk)

## Disclaimer: When writing the book, I decided to use quantitative results and simulations to illustrate points where possible rather than just drawing 'cartoons' of what I expected to happen. The models should be regarded as illustrative or prototype models rather than definitive results, most of them have NOT been peer-reviewed or subjected to as rigorous testing as published results in the primary literature would be. I provide them here as a source for claims made in the book and in case they are useful to other people, with no guarantee of accuracy.
